# UI Design System — "Sky-Blue" (SaaS, light + dark)

A single, consistent design system across every page. The product reads as a
polished, high-end SaaS application: a sky-blue brand with a bright-sky accent,
dark navy-blue mesh showcases, generous whitespace, soft layered shadows, and a
full light **and dark** theme.

> **Direction history (user-requested).** Started as "Sky-Blue editorial", moved
> to "Modern SaaS (indigo)", then "Emerald Luxe", now back to **"Sky-Blue"**
> (per the supplied `Demo/skillswap-demo.html` reference) — a clean sky-blue
> identity on cool blue-grey neutrals, with green reserved for success/"teach"
> and amber for "want/learn" tags. The absolute product rules are unchanged:
> **no fabricated stats/activity/testimonials, no AI branding, no monetary
> features.** The landing conveys premium *feel* through design and honest
> content — it invents no numbers, logos, or reviews.

## Theming

- Tokens live in `static/css/_variables.css`. `:root` is the light theme;
  `html[data-theme="dark"]` overrides surface/text/border/shadow tokens. The
  brand ramp is shared by both themes.
- Theme is toggled by the header button, persisted in `localStorage`
  (`skillswap-theme`), and applied **before paint** by a tiny inline script in
  `base.html` (no flash). `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">`.
- Retheme the whole app by editing the brand ramp — every component uses tokens.

## Palette

| Role | Token(s) | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Brand | `--brand-50 … --brand-800` (sky blue) | primary actions, links, active nav, accents |
| Partner | `--teal-500/600` (cyan-blue) | info |
| Accent | `--accent-400/500/600` (bright sky) | hero accent text, feature-tile highlight |
| Signature gradients | `--gradient-brand` (sky→deep-sky), `--gradient-gold` (sky→bright-sky) | buttons, brand mark, CTA |
| Hero mesh | `--hero-ink` + `--hero-mesh` | dark navy-blue hero, showcase visual, free band |
| Surfaces | `--surface`, `--surface-2/3`, `--bg` | cards, page background (per theme) |
| Text | `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--text-subtle` | copy hierarchy (per theme) |
| Semantic | `--success/danger/warning/info` (+ `-bg`/`-bd`) | flash, status badges |

## Backgrounds (proxy-safe)

External image requests don't survive the dev path-rewriting proxy (same reason
CSS is inlined). So all "imagery" is **inline and dependency-free**:
- Page background: faint sky radial glow + a dot-grid **SVG data URI**
  (`--bg-texture`), fixed attachment.
- Hero / showcase / free band: layered radial-gradient **mesh** (`--hero-mesh`)
  over `--hero-ink`, plus a subtle **SVG `feTurbulence` grain** overlay (`--noise`).

## Typography

System sans (`--font-sans`, Nunito Sans if present), bold tight headings, `.display`
for hero, `.eyebrow` kickers, `.lede` intros. Scale in `_typography.css`.

## Components

Elevated cards with hover lift; gradient `.btn-primary`, plus secondary / ghost /
danger / white / **outline-light** (for dark heroes) and sizes; sticky blurred
header with active links + theme toggle + notification pill; skill/status badges;
status-coloured flash; dashed empty states; avatars (image or gradient initials).
Landing/luxury pieces: **announcement bar**, **trust chips**, gradient **feature
tiles**, **showcase** split with a glass match-card mockup, **principle** cards,
dark **"$0 / forever" free band**, native **FAQ accordion** (`<details>`),
**CTA band**, multi-column **footer**. Widgets: **scroll-reveal**
(IntersectionObserver, safe-by-default — hidden only under `html.js`, with a
load-time fallback so content is never stranded) and **back-to-top**.

## CSS organization

```
static/css/
├── _variables.css   # tokens: brand ramp, gradients, mesh, textures, spacing,
│                     #         radius, shadow, type + dark-theme overrides
├── _base.css        # reset, body background, reveal animation (html.js gated)
├── _typography.css  # heading/display/eyebrow/meta scale

├── _buttons.css     # button variants + sizes
└── _forms.css       # inputs, filter bar, form card, validation
```

Hand-written CSS only — no framework, no Node/npm build. The stylesheet is
**inlined** by `apps/common/templatetags/assets.py` (`{% inline_css %}`) so it
survives the dev path-rewriting proxy (see docs/DECISIONS.md D-B). JS is vanilla
and inline in `base.html` (theme toggle, reveal, back-to-top) and the chat poller.

## Product voice

Natural, human, specific — "Learn anything by teaching what you know.",
"Trade skills, not money.", "Free, and always will be." Never AI-powered.
